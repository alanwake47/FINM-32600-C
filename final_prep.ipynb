    "- what's the difference between a reference and a pointer?\n",
    "  - The main difference is that a reference is an alias for an existing object, whereas a pointer is an object in its own right. We can change the value of a pointer, but we cannot change the value of a reference.\n",
    "  - Similarities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both pointers and references allow indirect access to the memory locations of variables or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both pointers and references can be used to pass arguments to functions by reference instead of by value, allowing changes made to the arguments within the function to affect the original variables or objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both pointers and references can be used to create dynamic data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: Pointers are declared using the * symbol, while references are declared using the & symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nullability: Pointers can be assigned a null value, which means they don't point to any valid memory location. References, on the other hand, must always refer to a valid object or variable and cannot be null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment: Pointers can be reassigned to point to different memory locations, whereas references cannot be reassigned to refer to a different object or variable after initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointer arithmetic: Pointers can be incremented or decremented to point to different memory locations, and pointer arithmetic can be used to iterate through arrays or manipulate memory. References do not support pointer arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type checking: Pointers can be declared to point to any data type, including void. References, on the other hand, must be initialized to refer to an object or variable of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management: Pointers require explicit memory management, meaning that the programmer is responsible for allocating and deallocating memory for the pointer. References, on the other hand, are automatically managed by the language's garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, pointers and references are similar in their ability to provide indirect access to memory locations, but differ in their syntax, nullability, assignment, type checking, and memory management."

    "Main Concepts - Roadmap: \n",
    "- 1. Classes and Objects\n",
    "  - Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming. A class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class, i.e., an object.\n",
    "- 2. Data Abstraction and Encapsulation\n",
    "  - Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. Encapsulation refers to the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. An object is an example of encapsulation as it contains both data and functions. Public and private access specifiers are used to achieve encapsulation in C++.\n",
    "  - Encapsulation refers to combining data and functions inside a class so that data is only accessed through the functions of the class.\n",
    "- 3. Inheritance\n",
    "    - Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, and the classes that we derive from are called base classes. Using inheritance, we can reuse the code functionality of the base class. It represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.\n",
    "- 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "  - Polymorphism means \"many forms\", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance. Like we specified in the previous chapter; inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways. For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.): The pig says: wee wee, the cat says: meow meow."

If the macro is already defined, the header file is not included again."
