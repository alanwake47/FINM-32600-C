For example, a Rectangle is a Shape, so Rectangle can be derived from Shape. Inheritance is also used to express a \"has-a\" relationship between two classes. For example, a Car has an Engine, so Car can contain an Engine object as a member variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "is a design pattern in C++ that defers the initialization of an object or variable until it is actually needed. This can be useful in situations where the initialization of an object is expensive or time-consuming, and you want to avoid doing it until it is absolutely necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lazy initialization, you typically create a placeholder object or variable that represents the uninitialized state of the object. When the object is actually needed, you initialize it on demand and replace the placeholder with the fully initialized object. This allows you to avoid the cost of initialization until it is actually required, improving performance and reducing memory usage.\n",

    "One common way to implement lazy initialization in C++ is to use a static local variable in a function. For example, consider the following code:\n",

On subsequent calls, the already-initialized instance variable is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to implement lazy initialization is to use the singleton design pattern. In this pattern, you create a class with a private constructor and a static method that returns a reference to a static instance of the class. The first time the static method is called, the instance is created using the private constructor, and on subsequent calls, the already-created instance is returned.\n",

    "Virtual functions allow a function in a base class to be overridden by a function with the same signature in a derived class. When a virtual function is called on an object, the implementation of the function that is called depends on the type of the object at runtime. This means that if a pointer or reference to a base class is used to call a virtual function on a derived class object, the implementation of the virtual function in the derived class will be called.\n",
